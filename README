== ARPP is an Arduino to XMPP gateway

This project aims to setup a Rails server to act as a gateway
between an Arduino board and a XMPP client. We already have the code to
receive a HTTP GET from the board and connect to a XMPP server to deliver
the message received from the board. We have to polish it and turn it into
a simple web service with this workflow:

   1. A user creates an account with username, password, email
   2. The user registers a device, binds it to a XMPP account and gets a device ID
   3. The device ID is stored in the firmware of the Arduino board and is sent
      into every HTTP GET made by the board to the server
   4. The server receives messages from the devices and delivers them to their XMPP accounts. 

The sw for steps 1 and 2 is to be done. 
The sw for step 3 is out of scope but might be included in the project
as a demo.
The sw for step 4 already exists but should be converted to a DRb approach. Some untested
code is inside the DRb directory.
