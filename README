ARPP is an Arduino to XMPP gateway
==================================

This is a Rails server that acts as a gateway
between an Arduino board and a XMPP client.
The workflow is simple:

   1. A user creates an account with username, password, email
   2. The user enters an existing XMPP account and gets a device ID
   3. An Arduino board makes HTTP POSTs to the server containing a message
      and the device ID
   4. The server extract the message from the device and delivers it to the
      XMPP account associated with the device ID

A service based on this code is online at http://arppr.connettiva.eu

If you want to roll your own server, make sure to configure the
app/model/user_mailers.rb file or you'll get errors when user registers.

TO DO
=====
The code to send IMs should be converted to a DRb approach. Some untested
code is inside the DRb directory and in the arduino model.
